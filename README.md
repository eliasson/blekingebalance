# Blekinge Balance

Android application to read balance from Blekingetrafiken's reskort.

It is a very simple application that reads the NFC chip and tells you the balance on your 'Reskassa', no more than that.

**NOTE** This application does *not* write anything to your card, it only reads the data.

**NOTE** This is not an official application, nor is the vendor in any way associated with Blekingetrafiken.
